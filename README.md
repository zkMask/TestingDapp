# ZKMask 
## (Easy and Secure transactions using 2 Factor Authentication)

Once the keys are lost the Funds are too! 
But ZKMask adds an extra layer of Security to save all those funds by leveraging AI Face Verification and ZK Proofs.

ZKMask is the ultimate 2 Factor Authentication app needed to secure all transactions through Face Verification and Prooving it by Zero Knowledge Proof. The DeepFace AI model verifies if the owner of the key is the one signing the transaction and the Zero Knowledge smart contract generates the proof for the same after which only the user signs the transaction and makes it go through. This 2 Factor Authentication using the  Deepface AI model and Zero Knowledge Proof brings reliability to the security layer added through ZKMask.

## 
The problem of losing funds due to losing control over the private key is a very common problem that many crypto users face. ZKKMask solves this problem by adding an additional layer of security by which even the wallets with compromised keys wallets remain safe. This additional layer of security uses concepts of Artificial Intelligence and Zero-Knowledge for verification using various Face alignments, detection, embeddings and features extraction and ------------- using Zero Knowledge Concepts.

Users have to first register their Identity on the ZKMask mobile app by capturing their photo for future verification. Later this sample is used as a sample for face verification when the user wants to perform 2FA before signing a transaction. During 2FA the captured face image is taken and passed through the DeepFace AI model that checks if the captured image has any resemblance with the images registered already on our App. If YES the image is passed for Proof generation by ZK Model or else is rejected and 2FA fails and the transaction security is maintained. 

In the ZK Model the face ---------------------------------------------------.
This ensures that the face verification done by the AI model is done correctly and ZK gives the Proof for same.
 
The App is Deployed on Goerli, Gnosis Chiado testnet, ---------------------------.
